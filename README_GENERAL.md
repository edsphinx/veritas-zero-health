## Project Vision

Our mission is to invent and deploy ethical infrastructure for a regenerative future, beginning with one of the most critical sectors: global health. We believe that technological progress must be paired with a deep commitment to individual empowerment and privacy.

This project is guided by the following core principles:

* **Global Health Sovereignty:** We are building tools that give individuals true ownership and control over their most sensitive health data. Our goal is to dismantle centralized data silos and create a more equitable, patient-centric healthcare ecosystem.

* **Self-Sovereign Digital Identity:** We utilize decentralized technologies to establish a new model for digital identity in healthcare. Relationships between patients and institutions are managed on-chain, creating a transparent and tamper-proof layer of trust without relying on a central authority.

* **Data & Knowledge Sovereignty:** Our architecture ensures that sensitive information remains under the user's exclusive control. By leveraging cryptography and local-first storage, we enable individuals to share insights and verifiable proofs without ever exposing their raw data.

* **Commitment to Open Source:** We are dedicated to building in public and fostering a collaborative community. We believe that transparent, open-source development is essential for creating infrastructure that is truly trustworthy and beneficial for all.

## The Problem: Data & Trust in Clinical Research

The process of recruiting patients for clinical trials is fundamentally broken. It suffers from deep-seated inefficiencies and a growing trust deficit:

* **Privacy Risks:** Patients are required to share highly sensitive personal health information with centralized entities, creating significant privacy risks and data security vulnerabilities.
* **Recruitment Friction:** Researchers spend vast resources on patient verification, a slow and manual process that significantly delays the timeline for critical medical research.
* **Data Silos:** Patient data is fragmented across multiple, non-interoperable healthcare systems, making it difficult for individuals to control their own information or participate in new research opportunities.
* **Lack of Verifiability:** It is difficult to prove compliance and participation in a transparent and tamper-proof manner, which can lead to disputes and inefficiencies.

These issues not only slow down the pace of innovation but also create barriers to entry for diverse patient populations, perpetuating inequities in medical outcomes.

## Our Solution: Verifiable Anonymity

Veritas Zero Health introduces a paradigm shift. Instead of patients handing over their data for verification, our protocol enables them to generate cryptographic proof of their eligibility **without revealing the underlying data itself.**

A patient can mathematically prove facts like "I am between the ages of 30 and 45" or "My cholesterol is below 200 mg/dL" to a researcher's smart contract. The researcher can trust the proof's validity without ever seeing the patient's actual age or medical records. This model builds a trustless and secure bridge between patients and researchers, protecting individual privacy while accelerating scientific discovery.

## Core Components

Our protocol is built on a stack of interoperable, open-source technologies:

1.  **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** At the core of our system, ZKPs allow for the private verification of data. Circuits are designed to validate common clinical trial criteria (e.g., age ranges, biomarker levels), and proofs are generated client-side on the patient's device.
2.  **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs):** We use non-transferable ERC721 tokens (`ProofOfMatch`) to represent the official, on-chain relationship between a patient and a research institution. This SBT acts as a form of self-sovereign digital identity within the healthcare ecosystem.
3.  **Real-World Asset (RWA) NFTs:** Trial access and participation milestones can be tokenized as NFTs. These can be managed by our `CommitmentVault` escrow system, a two-party contract that ensures fair exchange and commitment from both the patient and the institution.
4.  **Local-First, Encrypted Storage:** All sensitive patient data is stored and encrypted exclusively on the patient's local device. The protocol never takes custody of user data, ensuring true data sovereignty.

## An Ethical & Regenerative Framework

Veritas Zero Health is architected from the ground up as a piece of **ethical infrastructure**:

* **Privacy by Design:** The system is structurally incapable of exposing user data, shifting the power dynamic from data extraction to user empowerment.
* **Reduced Bias:** By lowering the barrier to verification, the protocol can help create more diverse and equitable trial cohorts.
* **Trust Through Transparency:** The use of open-source code and public blockchain records for verification (not data) creates a transparent and auditable system for all participants.

This framework is **regenerative** by:

* **Accelerating Research:** By dramatically reducing the time and cost of patient recruitment, we can help bring new therapies and treatments to market faster.
* **Rebuilding Trust:** We foster a new, more equitable relationship between patients and the research community, encouraging broader participation in science.

## System Architecture

The project is a monorepo built with Turborepo and pnpm workspaces.

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | Next.js, React, wagmi, viem, shadcn/ui | User interface for patients and researchers. |
| **Smart Contracts** | Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat | On-chain logic for identity (SBTs), escrow (Vaults), and ZK verification. |
| **ZK Circuits** | Noir / Circom | Logic for generating and verifying proofs of medical data. |
| **Local Storage** | IndexedDB with encryption | Secure, client-side storage for patient medical records. |

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, please ensure you have Node.js (v18+) and pnpm installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/veritas-zero-health.git](https://github.com/your-username/veritas-zero-health.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd veritas-zero-health
    ```

3.  **Install all dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The main web application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Roadmap

* **Expanded ZK Circuit Library:** Develop a comprehensive, open-source library of ZK circuits for common clinical trial inclusion/exclusion criteria.
* **DAO Governance:** Transition protocol ownership and governance to a decentralized autonomous organization composed of patients, researchers, and institutions.
* **Mobile Application:** Develop native mobile applications for iOS and Android to increase accessibility and leverage secure enclave features for key management.
* **Integration with EHR Systems:** Build secure bridges to allow patients to optionally import their electronic health records (EHR) into their local data vault.
