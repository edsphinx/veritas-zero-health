# Script to fix common ESLint errors across the codebase

echo "Fixing common ESLint errors..."

# Fix unused imports and variables by prefixing with _
# This is safer than removing them as they might be used in the future

# Example patterns to fix:
# - Unused imports
# - Unused variables
# - Unescaped quotes in JSX
# - any types (these are warnings but need to be addressed)

# For now, let's just report what needs to be fixed
echo "Errors to fix:"
echo "1. Unused variables/imports - prefix with _"
echo "2. Unescaped quotes in JSX - use &apos; &quot; etc"
echo "3. 'any' types - replace with proper types"
echo "4. <img> tags - add eslint-disable comment or use next/image"
echo "5. React Hook dependencies - add missing deps or disable"

echo "Run: pnpm lint to see all errors"
